Entry Selector
===

Simply selection of an array and removal of selected item from the array for subsequent iterations. Yes, you could roll dice or some other method, but this is a JavaScript group, so this overkill is here.

Add an `entries.js` file that exports an object with a property called `entries` that is an array containing the entries. See `entries-example.js`.
